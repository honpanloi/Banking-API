# Banking API
The Banking API will manage the bank accounts of its users. It will be managed by the Bank's employees and admins. Employees and Admins count as Standard users with additional abilities. All users must be able to update their personal information, such as username, password, first and last names, as well as email. Accounts owned by users must support withdrawal, deposit, and transfer. Transfer of funds should be allowed between accounts owned by the same user, as well as between accounts owned by different users. Standard users should be able to register and login to see their account information. They can have either Checking or Savings accounts. Employees can view all customer information, but not modify in any way. Admins can both view all user information, as well as directly modify it.
